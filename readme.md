## Deployment Note

  For the deployment of the backend application, it is crucial to deploy it on [Render](https://render.com/). Render maintains the state of the file system between builds and redeployments, which is essential for using disk storage with Multer.

  If you choose to deploy the app using other services, consider these options:

  - **Serverless Deployment**: Use Multer's memory storage since serverless platforms don't retain file system state between deployments.
  - **Serverful Deployment**: Render is recommended to ensure the file system state is preserved, but other platforms might work if they support persistent storage.
